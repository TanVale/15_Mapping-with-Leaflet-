# 15_Mapping-with-Leaflet
In this challenge I have done the following - 
- Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
- Ploted the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
- Added other base maps to choose from.
- Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
- Added layer controls to the map.
